# Decisions log (playtest 1)

Every "(default — confirm)" choice taken during the run, numbered as in `plan.md` §14, with where it is coded;
every runtime dependency (why, licence, size); every deviation from the plan found while running. The author
overrules any line by number.

## Run-start findings (sanity check, 2026-10-29)

- **Remote exists.** `github.com/ruyadorno/pm-tycoon` was created by the author (public, Pages source "GitHub
  Actions", ruy-bot app installed on it) and this checkout is a clone with `origin` set and an initial README
  commit, so `git init -b main` was skipped. Per plan.md §13.2 ("once the author has created the remote, push with
  `git push origin main` only") the run pushes `main` at milestone checkpoints; no branches, no PRs, no Pages deploy.
  AGENTS.md's git-auth paragraph was updated to say so (the template predates the repo).
- **`.github/workflows/pages.yml` is committed last.** Whether the app token has Workflows: write cannot be checked
  without pushing a workflow file; holding it until the final commit means a refusal cannot block the checkpoint
  pushes. (plan.md §6.12 / Q58.)
- **PixelLab MCP already visible from the repo.** The author's registration covers both `~/agents/main` and this
  repo path at local scope, so the user-scope re-registration of plan.md §10 step (2) was skipped; the token was
  copied into the gitignored `.env` for the REST client without being printed. `GET /v2/balance`: Tier 2, 5,000
  generations, $0 credits.
- **Chromium**: Playwright 1.64.1 installs Chrome for Testing 156 without root; SwiftShader WebGL works (max
  texture 8192, `OES_standard_derivatives`); the `iPhone 16` descriptor exists (no R11 fallback needed).
- **`@types/node@26.6.6`** added as a dev dependency (not in plan.md §6.2): `tools/**` and `vite.config.ts` import
  `node:*` modules and `tsconfig.json` typechecks them; `types` is `["vite/client", "node"]`.
- **vite 8 / rolldown** rejects the object form of `manualChunks`; the phaser chunk is split with the function form.

## Runtime dependencies

- `phaser@4.2.1` — the engine (MIT). ~1.2 MB min / ~0.3 MB gz in its own chunk.
- `eventemitter3@5.0.4` — typed sim event bus imported by `src/sim` directly instead of through Phaser (MIT, ~3 KB).

## Runtime dependencies (audio)

- **`tone@15.1.22`** (MIT, Yotam Mann). It is the audio clock.
  - The Transport gives tempo, a 4/4 loop over 68 bars, and one scheduleRepeat callback per bar, about 0.15 s ahead on the audio clock.
  - Its tick timeline (getTicksAtTime) places stingers on the band's swung grid.
  - Tone creates no sound-producing nodes here. Its Transport keeps one internal ConstantSourceNode (the bpm signal), never connected to the output.
  - Import rule: only src/audio/tone.ts imports Tone, through `tone/build/esm/core/Global.js` and `core/clock/Transport.js`. Tone's index module calls getContext() at import time, which would create a second AudioContext (phaser4-notes §6).
  - Size, measured in a rolldown production build: 173 KB min / 45 KB gz in its own chunk (Transport plus standardized-audio-context). The audio.md estimate was ~100–150 KB gz.
- **`smplr@1.1.0`** (MIT, danigb). It plays sampled General MIDI instruments from a SmplrPreset (the vendored FluidR3_GM notes).
  - One shared SampleLoader means each mp3 is fetched and decoded once.
  - `notesToLoad` with the 'nearest' fallback pitch-shifts between samples spaced 3 semitones apart.
  - renderOffline gives the WAV render metrics of audio.md §9.5.
  - smplr's interval-polling scheduler is replaced by an immediate one (src/audio/instruments.ts).
  - Size: 25.7 KB min / 9.8 KB gz.
  - Samples: 47 mp3 files, 1,025,371 B, under CC-BY 3.0 (public/audio/sf/LICENSE.txt, CREDITS.md). tests/audio/assets.test.ts enforces the 3 MB budget, so `vlr check` fails above it.
- **ZzFX 1.4.0** (MIT, Frank Force) is not a dependency (Q72). Only buildSamples() is vendored, in src/audio/zzfx-samples.ts, with the MIT header, a seeded random source and the sample rate as parameters. Its output is bit-identical to the npm tarball. The upstream module creates an AudioContext at import.

## Defaults taken — audio (plan.md §14)

- **Q46 — pauseOnBlur false + AudioDirector.**
  - The director owns visibility. Phaser 'hidden' and window 'pagehide' pause the band, stop every voice (stingers included) and suspend the context.
  - On return nothing plays until a tap: the Paused card calls resumeAfterPause(). A capture-phase tap watcher (pointerdown, pointerup, touchend, keydown) also resumes on the next tap, and retries when iOS leaves the context 'interrupted', even while the page stays visible.
  - Nothing sounds before the Title tap, whatever the autoplay policy allows. The unlock resumes the context and Tone inside the gesture.
  - Desktop blur/focus is ignored. Boot must set `game.sound.pauseOnBlur = false`.
  - Audio never throws into the game: setup, data or handler failures leave a working game, and the reason goes to state().errors.
  - Code: src/audio/director.ts.
- **Q47 — music keeps playing at 0× and under the lost-life card.** Only a tab hide pauses the Transport. life:lost does a one-beat tape-stop and resumes. The hiss, stall-alarm and grumble loops wait while `lookups.isPaused()` is true.
- **Q48 — drumless v1.** semver-swing.json has `parts.brushes: false`. The synthesized ride and hat (zzfx noise buffers, high-passed at 7 / 8 kHz, about 15 dB under the band) sit behind that flag or `audio.json brushes.override: true`. The ride/hat arrays in audio.md §5 rendered silence (frequency 0) and were fixed.
- **Q49 — samples vendored at step 3.** That is 1.03 MB (1,025,371 B, 47 files), well under the 3 MB budget. `vlr audio:vendor -- --step 1` vendors every semitone; `node tools/audio/vendor.mjs --check` and tests/audio/assets.test.ts verify the budget offline.
- **Q50 — 18 SFX.** sfx.json has 20 keys: the 18 plus ride and hat. Throttles live in audio.json:
  - pickup 150 ms, hiss 4 s, honks 3 s overall, stall alarm 8 s, grumble 20 s;
  - the loops respect them on every play, including the first, with a 250 ms timer slack (`throttleSlackMs`).
- **Q51 — live music, unheard; music: 'live'.**
  - One render-metric iteration was used (gain staging).
    - Before: −43…−46 dBFS per bar at the starting volumes.
    - Changes: +22 dB sampler make-up trim; a master safety limiter; instrument volumes piano 74 / bass 87 / vibes 116 / trumpet 80; pad velocity 60; zzfx volume 0.5.
    - After: bars 0–63 at −22.4…−25.3 dBFS, peak 0.44, tail −120 dBFS.
    - Phone-weighted balance relative to the trumpet melody: bass −3, piano −5, pads −12 dB.
  - Composition changes:
    - the final chord became F6/9 with a final F5 melody note;
    - the arranger voice-leads the whole comping sequence, scoring each candidate after its clash fix;
    - the piano never rubs (semitone or b9) against, nor doubles, the tune, and the root is never its lowest voice;
    - the vibes pads never double the piano;
    - walking-bass passing tones resolve by step;
    - the only cross-part unison is the written trumpet + vibes unison of chorus 2.
  - Verdict: "unheard on this VM — author to judge".
- **Q52 — Credits.** CREDITS.md audio section (text supplied) plus the Title-screen Credits card, which the integration adds.
